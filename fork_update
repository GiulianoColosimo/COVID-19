# Add the remote, call it "upstream":
# I am not sure if this has to be run everytime or only the first time
git remote add upstream https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19.git


# Fetch all the branches of that remote into remote-tracking branches,
# such as upstream/master:
git fetch upstream

# Make sure that you're on your master branch:
git checkout master


# Rewrite your master branch so that any commits of yours that
# aren't already in upstream/master are replayed on top of that
# other branch:
git rebase upstream/master
